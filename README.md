# eYRC 2019-20 ‚Äì Team ARC-RIT

This repository documents our participation in the **e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) 2019-20**, organized by **IIT Bombay**. The competition challenged us to solve real-world robotics problems using simulation and embedded platforms across a series of structured tasks.


## üë• Team ARC-RIT

We are an **interdisciplinary team of engineering students** from **Ramco Institute of Technology**, representing the **Automation and Robotics Club (ARC-RIT)**. Our core focus lies in building practical and scalable robotics solutions by leveraging skills from multiple engineering domains.

## üß† Problem Theme ‚Äì eYRC 2019-20

The problem statement was delivered as a **gamified engineering challenge**, simulating a robotics use-case in a virtual environment. Our solution involved developing algorithms, designing control logic, and interfacing with simulation platforms to complete tasks over multiple evaluation rounds.


## üìÅ Contents

This repository includes code and documentation for the **two primary tasks** assigned in our theme:
